This repository contains the source code for implementing Convolutional Neural Network based Traffic sign recognition on Tiva TM4C123G LaunchPad Evaluation Kit.

The training and test data set can be downloaded from https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net%2Ftopher%2F2017%2FFebruary%2F5898cd6f_traffic-signs-data%2Ftraffic-signs-data.zip%3AWO3Nq9Ds8s63rCvcn6CrIqXkNk0&cuid=4444009

The code cmsisCNN/python/cnn_traffic.py contains the python for training the model from the given training set.

The folder cmsis_cnn_NokiaLCD contains the complete source code.

Before running the code, CMSIS-DSP Library has to be downloaded from https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS.
Step-by-Step instructions for setting up the CMSIS-DSP library are given in www.ti.com/lit/an/spma041g/spma041g.pdf
